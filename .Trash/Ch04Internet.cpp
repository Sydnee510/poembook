  /*
    negative hours, hours over the maximum hours for a month
    second validation needs year and month.

    Extra credit part:
In the sample program, our input validation for hours only checks negative hour. It doesnâ€™t check if the hours used is over the maximum hours for a month. Please add this part to the input validation of hours.
Two more input item are needed: year, and month
Step 1: ask the month
Step 2: validate the month (1-12)
Step 3: check if the month is 1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12. These months has 31 days
Step 4: check is the month is 4, 6, 9, 11. These months has 30 days
Step 5: if the month is 2, ask the year
Step 6: validate the year
Step 7: if the year is a leap year, then feb has 29 days, otherwise 28 days
Step 8: calculate the maxHours for the month
